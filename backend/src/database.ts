// In a production environment, you would initialize your database client (e.g., Prisma, TypeORM, node-postgres) here.

// For this mock setup, data is managed in memory by dataService.ts,
// so this file doesn't need to do anything. We export an empty object
// just to make it a valid module and prevent import errors.
